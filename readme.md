Getting Started
---------------
From time-to Time, you may encounter structures like this in your world:

![Glitch Structure](readme-images/GlitchCore.png)

This represents where the code has failed, and has created the foothold for an exploit.

Unfortunately, you can't remove the glitch itself, but with the proper tool, you can collect some information about the crash.

![Glitch Harvester](readme-images/recipieHarvester.png)

And use an analyzer to search for possible exploits.

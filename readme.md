Getting Started
---------------
From time-to Time, you may encounter structures like this in your world:

![Glitch Structure](readme-images/GlitchCore.png)

This represents where the code has failed, and has created the foothold for an exploit.

Unfortunately, you can't remove the glitch itself, but with the proper tool, you can collect some information about the crash.

![Glitch Harvester](readme-images/recipieHarvester.png)

And use an analyzer to search for possible exploits.

![Guilded Redstone](readme-images/recipieGuildedRedstone.png)

![Emerald Glass](readme-images/recipieEmeraldGlass.png)

![CoreDump Analyzer](readme-images/recipieAnalyzer.png)

Sometimes, you will get a good exploit:

![An Exploit](readme-images/resultExploit.png)

Sometimes, you just get a mess of code:

![A Glitch Shard](readme-images/resultShard.png)

And other time, nothing!

There are a number of exploits available, but most of the only make sense on multiplayer servers.

Learning about them is half of the fun!

The shards are pretty pointless... maybe there is a use for them:

**WARNING: This mod contains fast-moving shaders, and may cause Epileptic fits, if you are prone to these, do NOT use this mod without turning the shaders off in the config**
